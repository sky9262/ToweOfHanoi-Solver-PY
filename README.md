The Tower of Hanoi is also known as the Tower of Brahma or the Lucas Tower. It is a mathematical game or puzzle that consists of three rods with ’n’ number of disks of different diameters.<br /><br />
The objective of the game is to shift the entire stack of disks from one rod to another rod following these three rules :<br />
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.<br />
2) Only the uppermost disk from one stack can be moved on to the top of another stack or an empty rod.<br />
3) Larger disks cannot be placed on the top of smaller disks.<br />
